## C-Sharp-Projects

Welcome to my C# Projects repository! This repository will hold all of the code I create as I work to complete the C# course from The Tech Academy. The goal here is to create a retrospective of my progress in C# over time, as well as, share some interesting and useful code with others. Please peruse through these files at your leisure. I hope you find something helpful and entertaining within!
