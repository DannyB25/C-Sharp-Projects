## C-Sharp-Projects

Welcome to my C# Projects repository! This repository holds some of the code I created as I worked to complete the C# course from The Tech Academy. The goal here is to create a retrospective of my progress in C# over time, as well as, share some interesting and useful code with others. Some examples of interesting builds include:

#### 1.) Twenty One
This is a program that allows the user to play an actual game of BlackJack. It features standard rules where the user faces a dealer and must submit bets, check/stay during rounds and reap the benefits (or losses) of their gambles through automatic bookkeeping. This program was built with basic and intermediate level C# code. It is a ton of fun and worth a play...or two....or three!

#### 2.) Car Insurance
Utilizing a MVC web application, I was able to create a simulation of a Car Insurance website. The way this program operates is a user inputs their contact information along with their driving history details and from that data a quote is derived by implementing business logic. In addition, an admin page was created as a means of summarizing and displaying all of the insurance applicants and their respective quote totals. If you have applied for insurance recently, this website will feel suprising familiar. 

#### 3.) Tech Store Inventory
This program was created using ASP.Net Core. This website is used as a catalog to denote customer orders. In lockstep with a database, the customer product, quantity and price are all entered and kept track of. In addition, the admin of the site is allowed to make edits or delete these records. It is a super utilitarian program and useful for any coders! 

Please peruse through these files at your leisure. I hope you find something helpful and entertaining within!
